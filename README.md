Code used in Intratumoral Microbiome Predicts Liver Metastasis and Informs Effective Treatment of Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor
 
 Contains model code and original microbiome read count matrix

 ### The most important script related to the model is placed in the modeling.R script. 
 
  Including batch effect removal, model training and feature extraction. 
  
  The training data used in the paper is placed in the Risk Model Data and Metastasis Model Data folders. 
  
  You can also use your own data to test the model.
  
  After clone this repositorie

  You can run 'Rscript modeling.R" or activate R environment to run this script 'source("modeling.R").
  Of course you need to install all dependent R packages.

  All machine learning related images in the paper will be reproduced.
